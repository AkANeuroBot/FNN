# FNN

There are different py project inside the repository, the architecture of the NNet is inside the net.py.
If you want to test the net you can lunch the others prog_th#.py programs, as you can see, this project will create a .csv file which contains all the data generated by the network. You will be able to change as you like the rules for saving or plotting data.

# net.py

Inside this file code you can find the structures of the two Neural Network that i create. The first one, _Cosine_Net_, is using a cosine squasher function as activation function of the hidden layer, the other one, _Logistic_Net_, use logistic function. The net consist in comparing these two N.N. in loss, efficiencies, etc. 
The code is written using object paradigma, so you can call instances of Network and compute training of one of them, or both...

# Disclaimer 

This project has been my Bachelor Thesis for University of Trieste. 
The only intent of the work is to **show** that's possible to create a Neural Network that can approximate any signal and extracting its feature through weights of the Net.
